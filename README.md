# assignments
This will be the repo where you can do your assignments

## How I can check your assignments
If you want me to check your homework you have to follow a couple of steps.

* Fork the repo
  * On the github page there is a button saying fork. This will copy the code to your account.
* Go to your own page and clone the repo
  * The name of the repo is on the page under the clone and download button, use either SSH or HTTPS.
* Once you have cloned the repo, go to the assignments dir /public/assignments/
* In here you can see every assignment that I will put on my website as well [royniels.nl](http://www.royniels.nl/categories/Assignment/).
* duplicate the braadworst dir and name it after your own username on github.
* Start doing the assignments, once you have finished you can add, commit and push your code like so
  * adding your code: git add --all
  * commiting your code: git commit -m "Your commit message"
  * git push origin master
* Your code is now on github on your own account. In order for me to check it you need to send a pull request.
  * Go to your profile and repo, there is a button pull request. click it
  * On top are two buttons with the word master in it. The first one should be your repo the second button the remote or in this case IWantToLearnProgramming.
  * Fill in some comments etc and press pull request button.
  * You are done, I can now check your code.
